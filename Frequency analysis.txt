Tried the frequency analysis and substituted the most occurring emojis with the letters E, T, A and O and the least occurring letters as Z, Q and X.
Got the cipher somewhat like this
statedy, pdcup bcmv ucddiwan maue frou the stairheal, bearinw a ...hiu on the uidl uorninw air. he hedl the bogd adoft anl intonel:
xintroibo al adtare lei.
hadtel, he peerel logn the larv ginlinw stairs anl maddel oct moarsedy:
xmoue cp, vinmh! moue cp, yoc fearfcd qescit!

A few lines felt similar like "he hedl the bogd adoft anl intonel" to "he held the bowl aloft and intoned" and "he peerel logn the larv ginlinw stairs" to "he peered down the stairs" which seemed like the opening lines of Ulysses by James Joyce (googled this)
